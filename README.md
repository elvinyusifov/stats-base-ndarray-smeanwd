## 🔍 Understanding the Algorithm

The application uses Welford's algorithm to calculate the mean. This method provides an optimal way to compute the average without storing all previous numbers, which saves memory and ensures accuracy. 

Here’s a brief overview of how Welford's algorithm works:

- It adjusts the mean as new numbers are added, ensuring precision.
- Each new value updates the mean incrementally instead of recalculating from scratch, which is efficient for large data sets.

## 📚 Additional Features

- **History:** Keep track of your previous calculations.
- **Export Function:** Save results as a text file for future reference.
- **User Guide:** Access help documentation within the app.
